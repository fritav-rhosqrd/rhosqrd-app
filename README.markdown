# RhoSqrd

RhoSqrd is a Qt-based front-end to the FRITAV database. It is also the starting point of the development of an information-management system (IMS) for linguistic data.

## Getting started

* Download the [latest release](https://github.com/fritav-rhosqrd/rhosqrd-app/releases/latest) for your plattform (currently macOS M1 only â€“ we plan releases for macOS Intel and Linux too).
* Click on the icon in the folder where the download is stored.
* You are ready to start querying FRITAV using RhoSqrd's GUI.
