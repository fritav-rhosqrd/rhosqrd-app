⚠️ **Warning: THIS PROJECT IS DEPRECATED** ⚠️
On September 7th, 2023, the development team of RhoSqrd has decided unanimously to give up on the refactoring of its original codebase. Instead, we have decided to split the project into smaller, more self-contained applications. This deprecation notice will link to RhoSqrd's successors once we have something that can be made public again.

# RhoSqrd

RhoSqrd is a Qt-based front-end to the FRITAV database. It is also the starting point of the development of an information-management system (IMS) for linguistic data.

## Getting started

* Download the [latest release](https://github.com/fritav-rhosqrd/rhosqrd-app/releases/latest) for your plattform (currently macOS M1 only – we plan releases for macOS Intel and Linux too).
* Click on the icon in the folder where the download is stored.
* You are ready to start querying FRITAV using RhoSqrd's GUI.
